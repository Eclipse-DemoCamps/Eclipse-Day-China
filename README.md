## Open letter

All information is at http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Kepler_2013/Beijing

I am software architect. I am organizing this free event for software developers, 
because I am interested in the technologies, and want to meet people who also are.

Currently I am looking for speakers and venue.

The event is free, but I need to know exact number of people who are coming,
because I need to find place to accommodate them.
That's why I require registration with real name & company/organization.

For students from one University, one contact person with list of attendees would be enough.

And check http://www.eclipse.org/
Now it has link Organize DemoCamp!

(We are going to have hackathon also!)

Feel free to contact.

## Invitation for cooperation

This is free event for developers in China.

There are 3 levels of possible cooperation:

1) You send/recommend some speakers (Chinese preferred  or it should be BIRT contributor ) to talk about BIRT solution.
That is very great topic. We also use BIRT in our company, and I think some developers may come just to listen to that topic.
(It may be other Eclipse related project as well).

2) You can help by providing venue, or sponsor with money for a venue to accommodate 100 people.
(We have option now, but it is just for up to 30 persons.)
We need to decide on venue question by the end of May, when we start advertising the event.
(I got approval that Funshion will be advertising it, so Funshion will be actually advertising/media sponsor)

3) You can help by becoming co-organizer:
Invite speakers & participants, search for venue, drinks, sponsorship; lead the event.

In case 2) or 3) we put you logo on wiki-page
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Kepler_2013/Beijing
in Organizer or Sponsors sections.
Call me if any other questions.
随时问问，英文中文都可以。
