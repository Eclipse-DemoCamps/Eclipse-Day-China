I am software architect. I am organizing this free event for software developers, 
because I am interested in the technologies, and want to meet people who also are.

Currently I am looking for speakers and venue.

The event is free, but I need to know exact number of people who are coming,
because I need to find place to accommodate them.
That's why I require registration with real name & company/organization.

For students from one University, one contact person with list of attendees would be enough.

And check http://www.eclipse.org/
Now it has link Organize DemoCamp!
